C++ Particle Simulator
===========================
This project is a particle simulator implemented in C++ using the SFML library. It visually simulates the behavior of particles under various physical forces and constraints.

Features: [Subject to future change]
===========================
Particle System: The simulator supports a system of multiple particles, each with customizable properties such as: Position, Velocity, Radius, Color

Collision Detection: Particles can collide with each other and with the boundaries of the simulation area.

Realistic Physics: The simulator can simulate: Gravity, Friction

Interactive Controls: Users can potentially interact with the simulation through: Adding or removing particles and Changing particle properties

How to Run:
===========================
Dependencies: Make sure you have the following installed:
A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
SFML development library
Compilation: Compile the source code using your preferred compiler.
For example: g++ main.cpp Particle.cpp -o particle-simulator -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system 
Execution: Run the compiled executable: ./particle-simulator

Future Development:
===========================
I plan to expand the simulator to include:
More advanced physics interactions (e.g., spring forces, electromagnetism)
Different types of particles with unique behaviors
A more sophisticated user interface for controlling the simulation.
Ability to use natural language processing to uniquely interact with the simulation.

About:
===========================
This project is being developed to further my understanding of C++, physics simulations, product development, AI and machine learning.
It is my hope to use this particle simulator in different product ideas.
